## 🌟 **The Story of AEPS & the Trusted Agent**

In a digital land called **AEPS City**, there was a smart system that helped people do banking using Aadhaar.

But first… no one could enter without becoming an **Agent** 👮‍♂️

---

## 🧑‍💻 Step 1: Becoming an Agent (Onboarding Gate)

When a new person came, AEPS said:

👉 *“First, let me onboard you.”*

So from the backend:

✅ One powerful API is called
→ It works for **all vendors**
→ Onboards the agent

During onboarding:

📦 Inventory is given to agent
💾 Entry is saved in database

Now the agent is ready 🎉

---

## 🔐 Step 2: Entering AEPS Module (Security Check)

When the agent logs in and opens **AEPS Module**, the system asks:

👉 “Are you properly equipped and verified?”

So it checks:

### ✔️ Inventory Check

* Does agent have inventory?
* If ❌ No → Access denied

### ✔️ KYC Check

* Is KYC complete?

If ❌ Not done
➡️ Redirect to KYC page 📄

If ✅ Done
➡️ Move forward 😄

---

## 🔑 Step 3: Daily 2FA Shield (Safety Wall)

Now AEPS activates its **daily security shield** 🛡️

It says:

👉 “Have you done 2FA today?”

So first API checks:

* If 2FA already done today ✅
  → Skip

* If not done ❌
  → Call 2FA validation API
  → Verify agent

After success → Door opens 🚪✨

---

## 💳 Step 4: The Transaction Arena

Now the agent enters the **Transaction Zone** ⚔️💰

Here, three powers are available:

### 1️⃣ Balance Enquiry 💼

→ Check customer balance

### 2️⃣ Mini Statement 📜

→ Last transactions

### 3️⃣ Cash Withdrawal 💸

→ Actual transaction

Agent can use any of these safely.

---

## 🌈 Final AEPS Journey (Story Flow)

1️⃣ Agent onboarded (Vendor API)
2️⃣ Inventory assigned + DB entry
3️⃣ Agent logs in
4️⃣ Inventory check
5️⃣ KYC check → Redirect if needed
6️⃣ Daily 2FA verification
7️⃣ Transaction allowed
8️⃣ Balance / Statement / Withdrawal

And AEPS City runs smoothly and securely 😄✨

## 📌 One-Line Memory Trick
